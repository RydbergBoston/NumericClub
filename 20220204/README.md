## Contents
* A hamiltonian can be represented as an MPO, and an MPO is a state machine.
* One can represent a time evolution operator as an MPO without introducing Trotterization error,
* The partition function can be represented as a 2D continous MPO,
* Translational invariance can be used to compute the largest eigenvalue of the transfer matrix (variational).
